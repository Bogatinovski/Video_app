# Video_app

AngularJS app that allows the user to upload or paste link from a video. Then the user can cut many video segments from the attached video, give title and add tags for each video segment and also group the segments into various playlists. There are 2 parts of the application: The first is the admin panel where the user can attach video, create/edit segments and playlists. The second part is the public view where users can view the playlists or search individual segments by name or tags.
